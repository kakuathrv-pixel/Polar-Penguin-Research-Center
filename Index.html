    <h1 class="main">What Are Penguins</h1>
    <p class="sub">
        Penguins are flightless birds adapted for marine life, found primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, that are exceptional
        swimmers and divers. They have wings that function as flippers, dense bones for diving, and a waterproof coat of
        overlapping feathers for insulation. They primarily eat fish and krill, have predators like leopard seals and killer
        whales, and are well-adapted to various climates, from Antarctic ice to tropical islands.
    </p>

        </p>
        <h1 class="main">Emperor Penguin</h1>
        <p class="sub">
        The Emperor Penguin stands as the giant of its family—tall, regal, and remarkably resilient. These birds endure the
        coldest winters on Earth, marching across Antarctica’s frozen plains to breed. Fathers famously balance eggs on their
        feet for months while mothers hunt at sea, creating one of the most extraordinary parenting rituals in the animal
        kingdom.
        </p>
        <h1 class="main">King Penguin</h1>
        <p class="sub">
            Slightly smaller than emperors but equally striking, King Penguins wear a stunning splash of orange on their necks like
            a warm sunrise on icy water. They live in bustling colonies on sub-Antarctic islands and raise their chicks slowly,
            feeding them through harsh seasons until they’re ready to face the ocean’s shimmering blue frontier.
        </p>
        <h1 class="main">Adelie Penguin</h1>
        <p class="sub">
        Adelie Penguins are fiery little explorers of Antarctica, known for their curious, bold nature. With bright white eye
        rings and sharp tuxedo patterns, they roam rocky coastlines and build pebble nests in loud, lively colonies. Their
        energetic waddles and fearless attitude turn the harsh Antarctic landscape into a stage for endless tiny adventures.
        </p>
        <h1 class="main">Gentoo Penguin</h1>
        <p class="sub">
            Recognizable by the bright orange beak and a white “headband,” Gentoo Penguins are the speedsters of the penguin world.
            Underwater, they slice through the ocean at nearly 36 km/h, chasing fish like living arrows. They prefer cozy coastal
            homes on Antarctic islands and are known for their gentle personalities and neat stone nests.
        </p>
        <h1 class="main">Chinstrap Penguin</h1>
        <p class="sub">
            Chinstrap Penguins look like they’re always smiling—thanks to the thin black line curving under their chin. They are
            loud, spirited, and incredibly athletic, often climbing steep icy cliffs just to reach their nesting grounds. Among all
            penguins, they have one of the largest populations, filling the air with their unmistakable chatter.
        </p>
        <h1 class="main">Little Blue Penguin (Fairy Penguin)</h1>
        <p class="sub">
            The smallest penguin on Earth, the Little Blue Penguin, trades the classic black-and-white suit for a soft navy-blue
            coat. Found in Australia and New Zealand, they return to shore after dark, forming tiny parades of waddling blue
            shadows. Their gentle nature and miniature size make them one of the most adored penguin species.
